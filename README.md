# Embedded_Software_Meta_Model

This repository defines a metamodel allowing to model an embedded software
loaded on a single core microcontroller.  
The metamodel is framework and language independent.  
It is a set of metaclasses, relations and constraints dedicated to the modeling
of an embedded software.

The meta-model is defined through the following profiles :
* [Common elements](Common_Elements/Common_Elements.md)
* [Structuring elements](Structuring_Elements/Structuring_Elements.md)
* Functional requirement elements
* Functional architecture elements
* [Physical elements (physical software architecture and detailed design)](Physical_Elements/Physical_Elements.md)
